We worked on developing a modern and friendly
visual identity, that fit our target.

We settled a base colour palette with two shades of blue and purple,
trying to harmonize the app and the website's look and feel â€” you can
check the website here and it's case study there. Additionally,
we used grey for the text and plenty of light tones to keep the interface clean.

Being the colour associated with technology, Blue represents
trust, wisdom, confidence and stability. It has positive effects on
the mind and body and can cause it to produce chemicals that radiate calm
and tranquillity.

We went for a darker blue and a brighter blue on the app.
A corporate darker blue that exudes stability, honesty and trustworthiness,
balances out the brighter blue's engaging and dynamic hue.
