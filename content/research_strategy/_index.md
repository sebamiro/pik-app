Our research plan was kick-started by five central questions:

1. What are the most important technical and legal requirements and constraints when developing an instant payment/transfer service?

2. Who are our competitors? What are the market trends?

3. How does our target audience split expenses?

4. Which factors influence them the most when choosing a payment/transfer service?

5. Which pain points are they facing and how can we fix them?

Answering these questions was pivotal to assure we were building a true user-centric product that would effectively solve a real problem.
