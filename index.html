    <div><h2>Project summary</h2>
       
        <div style="max-width: 66ch;

            text-align: justify;">
            <p>Project developed with Lília Correia and Marta Casal,
under a Postgraduate Diploma in Digital Experience Design,
which consisted in designing an interactive or semi-functional
prototype of a digital product or service, following a user-centred approach</p>

    <div><h2>Context and Challenge (Ideation)</h2>
       
        <div style="max-width: 66ch;
            margin-inline: auto;
            margin-block-end: 5vh;
            text-align: justify;">
            <p>With the increasing digitalization of our society, consumers’
habits and expectations have been rapidly changing.
The trend of instant access to goods and services,
mainly through mobile phones, has driven the growth of real-time payments,
fast (instant) and simple.</p>

    <div><h2>Methodology</h2>
       
        <div style="max-width: 66ch;
            margin-inline: auto;
            margin-block-end: 5vh;
            text-align: justify;">
            <p>We followed a LEAN methodology throughout this project.
Our primary focus was always, first and foremost, on the perception
of our potential users’ needs, testing the solutions that emerged
and constantly iterating to improve the previously encountered
solutions’ hypothesis... Iterate until Awesome!</p>

    <div><h2>Research and Strategy</h2>
       
        <div style="max-width: 66ch;
            margin-inline: auto;
            margin-block-end: 5vh;
            text-align: justify;">
            <p>Our research plan was kick-started by five central questions:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What are the most important technical and legal requirements and constraints when developing an instant payment/transfer service?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Who are our competitors? What are the market trends?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does our target audience split expenses?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which factors influence them the most when choosing a payment/transfer service?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which pain points are they facing and how can we fix them?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Answering these questions was pivotal to assure we were building a true user-centric product that would effectively solve a real problem.</p>

    <div><h2>Interaction Design</h2>
       
        <div style="max-width: 66ch;
            margin-inline: auto;
            margin-block-end: 5vh;
            text-align: justify;">
            <p>Using all the information gathered during research, 
we kick-started the Interaction Design phase by listing all
the functional requirements we thought were important for our product.</p>
 
        </div>

        
    </div>

    <div><h2>Visual Design</h2>
       
        <div style="max-width: 66ch;
            margin-inline: auto;
            margin-block-end: 5vh;
            text-align: justify;">
            <p>We worked on developing a modern and friendly
visual identity, that fit our target.</p>
<p>We settled a base colour palette with two shades of blue and purple,
trying to harmonize the app and the website's look and feel — you can
check the website here and it's case study there. Additionally,
we used grey for the text and plenty of light tones to keep the interface clean.</p>
<p>Being the colour associated with technology, Blue represents
trust, wisdom, confidence and stability. It has positive effects on
the mind and body and can cause it to produce chemicals that radiate calm
and tranquillity.</p>
<p>We went for a darker blue and a brighter blue on the app.
A corporate darker blue that exudes stability, honesty and trustworthiness,
balances out the brighter blue's engaging and dynamic hue.</p>

    <div><h2>Prototyping</h2>
       
        <div style="max-width: 66ch;

            margin-block-end: 5vh;
            text-align: justify;">
            <p>I used InVision to connect the flow of all the screens I designed,
show the functioning of the product and do some testing.</p>
<p>Here's the link to my InVision prototype, both in walkthrough and power
user mode (create a group and add an expense user flows, plus the extra
screens I designed, like groups):</p>

    <div><h2>Presentation</h2>
       
        <div style="max-width: 66ch;
            margin-inline: auto;
            margin-block-end: 5vh;
            text-align: justify;">
            <p>The final presentation of the project was all about describing the problem
we tried to solve and our solution, demonstrating and explaining our approach.</p>
<p>We provided evidence, from real testimonies, that our product solves a
real issue. We described the segment we are targeting, our estimated
market size in Portugal, and what sets us apart from the competition.
We also discussed our launching strategy and prospective revenue sources.</p>

    <div><h2>Conclusion</h2>
       
        <div style="max-width: 66ch;
            margin-inline: auto;
            margin-block-end: 5vh;
            text-align: justify;">
            <p>Designing PayUp was a challenging ride. It was clear from the onset that
our major challenges would be getting to know the business fast, learning to
work as a cohesive team in a short period of time, and finding a value
proposition that could make young millennials ditch cash for electronic payments.</p>
